# Odin Recipes

Hello! This is my first website for The Odin Project. The project is a website
containing recipes. The goal of this is to have a good handle on my HTML skills
and be able to apply them to a real project. 

The website will include the use of links to connect to other webpages through
the use of `<a>` tags, images through the use of `<img>` tags, text styling and 
emphasis through the use of `<strong>`, `<em>`, and heading tags, and lists through
the use of `<ul>`, `<ol>`, and `<li>` tags.
